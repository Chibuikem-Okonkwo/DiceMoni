# DiceMoni
This game was made using Unity and C#. The game
is in 3-D and consists of two dice that roll on button
click and a score generator that picks the value of
each dice once it lands at rest in a box. The user has
6 rolls in total. The behaviour of GameObjects in
each scene was programmed using C#
